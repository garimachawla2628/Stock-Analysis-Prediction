# Stock-Analysis-Prediction
 Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is a project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using data provided by Yahoo Finance. Used pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. 

In this analysis, I have explored the following questions-

1. Visualize the historical prices.
2. Visualize the volume traded and identify the months in which the volume was the maximum.
3. What is the moving average of the various stocks?
4. What are the daily returns of the stocks?
5. What is the distribution of returns of stocks?
6. What is the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?
7. What is the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?
8. What is the volatility of stocks? 
9. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
10. How can we attempt to forecast future stock behavior?
